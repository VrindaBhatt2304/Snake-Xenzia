# Snake-Xenzia
Snake Xenzia is a classic arcade game. 
Here I've tried to replicate the same game using HTMLL,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
As the snake finds the food, it eats the food , and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible.
